## Viewing locally

These is a plain HTML file. You can directly open them in your browser, or `npx
vite` if you want a local dev server.

## Assets

The banner, logo and other marketing images are from the corresponding distro
websites. The screenshots are taken by me. Both have been modified for
presentation purposes.

The assets were converted to AVIF using [squoosh](https://squoosh.app).
